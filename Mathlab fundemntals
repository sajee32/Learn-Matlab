 pi is for 22/7 , sqrt for square root
 
 
 You can create arrays with multiple elements using square brackets
 ---------------------------------------
 If you know the number of elements you want in a vector (instead of the spacing between each element), you could instead use the linspace function:
linspace(first,last,number_of_elements).

Note the use of commas (,) to separate inputs to the linspace function.
x = linspace(0,1,5)
x = 
    0    0.250    0.500    0.750    1.000
